# General Typescript rules
1. Avoid types such as any, unknown, never.
2. Define types as narrow as possible, instead of "string"
3. Use logger from `@pnbj/core`
4. Before implementing some functionality, check if it already exists in a package or if there is a public one that makes sense to be used.
5. Config stays in `config.ts`
6. Interfaces and types and structs stay in `types.ts`
7. Always constrain to one implementation class per file.
8. Always write unit tests for each package.
9. Build with `bun run build`
10. Test with `bun run test`
11. Always try to follow SOLID principles
12. Write polymorphic interfaces and implementations
